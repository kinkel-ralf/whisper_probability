# Purpose of Fork
I want to help highly deaf people learn speaking, by providing a feedback loop for pronounciation. 
For now I adjusted Whisper to output probabilities instead of only the most likely text. 
This way people with hearing problems can pronounce the word again and again optimizing the assigned probability / logit of the word.

Forked from [OpenAI Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper), real-time implementation from [whisper_real_time](https://github.com/davabase/whisper_real_time/tree/master).

## Background
It's really hard for highly deaf people to learn pronounciation, as they lack the feedback loop of hearing. People losing their hearing might digress in speech, but it is even harder for people born deaf to learn speaking in the first place, here is an example of someone born deaf speaking [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V95p7EtGCI). Around 1/1000 people suffer from profound prelingual deafness. I think the feedback loop from speech-to-text models could be a great opportunity. One problem is that Whisper was not developed for this, so has some problems when used as pronounciation trainer. 

1. Using context -> This is great for transcriptions but for learning purposes, we would like for the model to not take into consideration the context too much. For the sentence "One the beach there are many grains of ...", the model would likely assign very high probability to "sand" even if mispronounced completely.

2. Training set skewed towards transcription -> Single words are almost not in the training set, it's unlikely that only "Should." is in the training set, what might be in the training set a few times is "Shoot!". So it's almost impossible to make it recognizing 'should' instead of 'shoot' if you don't add text afterwards.

3. English words might not be ideal for learning speaking because the pronounciation can be very misaligned with the way words are written. There is the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) which I think is more promising, as you have perfect alignment between how words are written and pronounced. I think a character level IPA speech-to-text model would be ideal for this learning purpose.

Some changes were made to make Whisper fit the pronouncation training task better.

## Changes
Core functionality: The _main_loop in decoding.py checks if the no_speech_prob is < 0.4 (current threshold), if that is the case, it then accumulates tokens (accumulation with lower_case and removing spaces) to output probabilities of the top 5. It also kicks out empty tokens or special tokens like "|start_of_recording|". It then plots the probabilities as bar charts.

Example with 6 predictions and top 2 being displayed:
"this":0.1, " this ":0.2, "This":0.1, "THIS":0.1, "here":0.1, "":0.4
=> Display "this":0.6, "here":0.1

Some other changes are to use only 1 beam, making whisper default to GreedyDecoder, we also don't iterate through temperatures (normally when nothing is found you iterate through (0,0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8,1)).

Whisper is a general-purpose speech recognition model. It is trained on a large dataset of diverse audio and is also a multitasking model that can perform multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, and language identification.
[come_to_decide.json](https://github.com/kinkel-ralf/whisper_probability/files/14201415/come_to_decide.json)


## Approach

![Approach](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openai/whisper/main/approach.png)

A Transformer sequence-to-sequence model is trained on various speech processing tasks, including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. These tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing a single model to replace many stages of a traditional speech-processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or classification targets.


## Setup

We used Python 3.9.9 and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) 1.10.1 to train and test our models, but the codebase is expected to be compatible with Python 3.8-3.11 and recent PyTorch versions. The codebase also depends on a few Python packages, most notably [OpenAI's tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) for their fast tokenizer implementation. You can download and install (or update to) the latest release of Whisper with the following command:

    pip install -U openai-whisper

Alternatively, the following command will pull and install the latest commit from this repository, along with its Python dependencies:

    pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git 

To update the package to the latest version of this repository, please run:

    pip install --upgrade --no-deps --force-reinstall git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git

It also requires the command-line tool [`ffmpeg`](https://ffmpeg.org/) to be installed on your system, which is available from most package managers:

```bash
# on Ubuntu or Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg

# on Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg

# on MacOS using Homebrew (https://brew.sh/)
brew install ffmpeg

# on Windows using Chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org/)
choco install ffmpeg

# on Windows using Scoop (https://scoop.sh/)
scoop install ffmpeg
```

You may need [`rust`](http://rust-lang.org) installed as well, in case [tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) does not provide a pre-built wheel for your platform. If you see installation errors during the `pip install` command above, please follow the [Getting started page](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) to install Rust development environment. Additionally, you may need to configure the `PATH` environment variable, e.g. `export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"`. If the installation fails with `No module named 'setuptools_rust'`, you need to install `setuptools_rust`, e.g. by running:

```bash
pip install setuptools-rust
```


## Available models and languages

There are five model sizes, four with English-only versions, offering speed and accuracy tradeoffs. Below are the names of the available models and their approximate memory requirements and inference speed relative to the large model; actual speed may vary depending on many factors including the available hardware.

|  Size  | Parameters | English-only model | Multilingual model | Required VRAM | Relative speed |
|:------:|:----------:|:------------------:|:------------------:|:-------------:|:--------------:|
|  tiny  |    39 M    |     `tiny.en`      |       `tiny`       |     ~1 GB     |      ~32x      |
|  base  |    74 M    |     `base.en`      |       `base`       |     ~1 GB     |      ~16x      |
| small  |   244 M    |     `small.en`     |      `small`       |     ~2 GB     |      ~6x       |
| medium |   769 M    |    `medium.en`     |      `medium`      |     ~5 GB     |      ~2x       |
| large  |   1550 M   |        N/A         |      `large`       |    ~10 GB     |       1x       |

The `.en` models for English-only applications tend to perform better, especially for the `tiny.en` and `base.en` models. We observed that the difference becomes less significant for the `small.en` and `medium.en` models.

Whisper's performance varies widely depending on the language. The figure below shows a performance breakdown of `large-v3` and `large-v2` models by language, using WERs (word error rates) or CER (character error rates, shown in *Italic*) evaluated on the Common Voice 15 and Fleurs datasets. Additional WER/CER metrics corresponding to the other models and datasets can be found in Appendix D.1, D.2, and D.4 of [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04356), as well as the BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) scores for translation in Appendix D.3.

## Command-line usage

The following command will transcribe speech in audio files, using the `medium` model:

    whisper audio.flac audio.mp3 audio.wav --model medium

The default setting (which selects the `small` model) works well for transcribing English. To transcribe an audio file containing non-English speech, you can specify the language using the `--language` option:

    whisper japanese.wav --language Japanese

Adding `--task translate` will translate the speech into English:

    whisper japanese.wav --language Japanese --task translate

Run the following to view all available options:

    whisper --help

See [tokenizer.py](https://github.com/openai/whisper/blob/main/whisper/tokenizer.py) for the list of all available languages.


## Python usage

Transcription can also be performed within Python: 

```python
import whisper

model = whisper.load_model("base")
result = model.transcribe("audio.mp3")
print(result["text"])
```

Internally, the `transcribe()` method reads the entire file and processes the audio with a sliding 30-second window, performing autoregressive sequence-to-sequence predictions on each window.

Below is an example usage of `whisper.detect_language()` and `whisper.decode()` which provide lower-level access to the model.

```python
import whisper

model = whisper.load_model("base")

# load audio and pad/trim it to fit 30 seconds
audio = whisper.load_audio("audio.mp3")
audio = whisper.pad_or_trim(audio)

# make log-Mel spectrogram and move to the same device as the model
mel = whisper.log_mel_spectrogram(audio).to(model.device)

# detect the spoken language
_, probs = model.detect_language(mel)
print(f"Detected language: {max(probs, key=probs.get)}")

# decode the audio
options = whisper.DecodingOptions()
result = whisper.decode(model, mel, options)

# print the recognized text
print(result.text)
```
